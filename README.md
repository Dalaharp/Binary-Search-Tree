# Binary-Search-Tree

This code is a C++ implementation of a binary search tree (BST), a data structure for organizing and managing a collection of elements. It defines a Node struct, where each node represents an element in the tree. The struct contains fields for the node's key (an integer value), left and right child pointers, and the size of the subtree rooted at the node.
